Unit testing means testing individual modules of an application in isolation 
(without any interaction with dependencies) to confirm that the code is doing things right.

Integration testing means checking if different modules are working fine when combined together as a group.

Functional testing means testing a slice of functionality in the system (may interact with dependencies) 
to confirm that the code is doing the right things.


Before you can move on to things like integration and functional testing, you need to make sure that the
code is correct and free of bugs at the unit level. So it makes sense to ask for unit tests at this point in developemnt.
